## Homework-1

You have a sample scene and an asset packgage.
This homework is based of the first 4 practices in https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBZtgJpHY6mISHcyCXRnOA/videos : 
 1. Intro to Unity
 2. Unity Basics
 3. C# Basics
 4. Physics

# Your tasks for it are:
 1. Setup a scene - make a level with the assets that are given.
 2. Make a player character and give him the ability to move

 4. Make a camera follow script - The task is to write a script that will make the camera follow the player. Bonus points if you can make the following motion smooth.
 5. Ground Detection - The task is to write a script that lets the player jump. Jumping is allowed only if the player was previously on the ground (otherwise he would be able to jump to infinity). 
 6. Dropping Platforms - It's pretty self-explanatory. When you jump on it it must drop down.
 7. Moving Platforms - Right or left. Up or down. As you wish.
 8. ** Pick Ups - In the asset package there is a key. Use this key and when the player move through it it will disappear. Output something in the console.
 9. ** Power Ups - Make a jumping pad or something similar.
 
# After you finish this homework your game may look something like:

# Notes:
The Asset Package is Bolt 2D, but if you want to use something else you can.
